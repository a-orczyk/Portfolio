# About me
I'm Angelika Grzegorczyk - a master of Intermedia arts in the University of Arts in Poznań, Poland. Currently working as the QA Tester in the company which provides the insource projects. I want to permanently improve my technical skills and develop testing knowledge. I have the experience in functional and exploratory testing for web and mobile apps. Especially, I am concerned in the UX and UI elements.
I would like to introduce myself here via sharing my gained experience, research and stuff which is interesting for me as the software tester.
